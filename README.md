# vax-gen

vax-gen is a tool for designing vaccines given the sequence of a pathogen and HLA-typing for a population. It is *not* intended for any kind of serious use, and *certainly* not for use without expert oversight. The prediction tools it depends on are simply not good enough.

The pipeline is inspired by (but does not directly use) pipelines for personalized cancer vaccine design.
